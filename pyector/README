Description
-----------
ECTOR is a learning chatterbot. pyECTOR is its python version.

ECTOR learns from what people say. It is based on a artificial
intelligence architecture, that is inspired from Copycat, an AI
system from Mitchell and Hofstadter.

The Concept Network it uses is a mix between neural and semantic
networks. It uses co-occurences to compute the influence of one
semantic node on another. The links are statistically weighted.

So, ECTOR does not know anything at its "birth".
It's to you to teach it.

Prerequisites
-------------
pyECTOR is written in Python so you need a Python interpreter
(version 2.5 or later) to execute pyector. Python is installed by
default in most Linux distributions.  You can download Python from the
official Python website http://www.python.org.

Obtaining pyECTOR
-----------------
The latest pyECTOR version and online documentation can be found at
http://pyector.googlecode.com/

Installation
------------
Once you've downloaded the file, untar it like that:
-------------------
tar -xvzf pyector-0_1.tar.gz .
-------------------

Usage
-----
usage: python Ector.py [-p username][-n botname=Ector][-v|-q][-l logfilepath][-s|-g][-h]

Be aware that ECTOR does not know anything at the beginning (first launch).
You have to teach it all!
It learns from what you say (so be polite and write well, if you want ECTOR
to do so).
