Introduction
------------

Ector.py is the python module which contains the Ector class, but also the main
program to use Ector.

This page explains how to use this program.


Run it
------

src/Ector.py is to be launched by typing this (provided that Python 2.5+ is
installed on your system) in a shell, in the root directory of the pyector
project:

--------------------
python src/Ector.py
--------------------

Options
~~~~~~~
There are several options you can use.

Here is the synopsis of the command (version 0.2):
--------------------
python Ector.py [-p username=User][-n botname=Ector][-l logfilepath=ector.log][-h]
--------------------

p --person
^^^^^^^^^^
This option gives the user name to Ector.
It is the name under which you are recognized by Ector.
It will be used to create a file `username_state.pkl` in which it will save the
last subjects you talk about (to simplify).

When you talk to Ector, you are named `username`, and nothing else. Don't use
other pseudos or nicknames.
The username is displayed before the prompt, so that you always know what's your
name ;)

By default, it is *`User`*.

You can always change this name during the interactive session by using the
`@person` command:

--------------------
User>@person Bill
Bill>
--------------------

n --name
^^^^^^^^
You can change the name of the bot, but its default name will be *`Ector`*.
The name you give is capitalized.

l --log
^^^^^^^
You can change the file in which the log is written.
By default, the file is `ector.log` and is saved in the current directory (from
where you launch Ector).

This is the same as the `@log` command.

h --help
^^^^^^^^
The help option reminds the usage of the program:
--------------------
$python src/Ector.py -h
Usage: Ector.py [-p username][-n botname=Ector][-v|-q][-l logfilepath=ector.log]
[-s|-g][-h]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p USERNAME, --person=USERNAME
                        set the name of the utterer
  -n BOTNAME, --name=BOTNAME
                        set the name of the bot
  -v                    say all that you can say
  -q                    shut up!
  -l LOGNAME, --log=LOGNAME
                        log the dialogue in log file
--------------------
Although some options are already present, they are not functional: -v, -q are
not applicable, as Ector does not answer, even in version 0.2.

Once you have launch the program, you get some license and copyright information:
--------------------

@help gives a basic help on pyECTOR commands.
User>
--------------------

From there, you can either type sentences you want Ector to learn, or use some
commands.
Let's see these commands.

@help
^^^^^
Typing `@help`, then enter will display all available commands:
--------------------
User>@help
You can just start typing phrases.
But there are some commands you can use:
 - @usage     : print the options of the Ector.py command
 - @quit      : quit
 - @exit      : quit
 - @bye       : quit
 - @person    : change the utterer name (like -p)
 - @name      : change the bot's name (like -n)
 - @version   : give the current version
 - @write     : save Ector's Concept Network and state
 - @shownodes : show the nodes of the Concept Network
 - @showlinks : show the links of the Concept Network
 - @log [file]: log the entries in the file (no file turns off the logging)
 - @status    : show the status of Ector (Concept Network, states)

--------------------

@usage
^^^^^^
Usage is the same than `-h, --help` option. It gives the synopsis of the program.

@quit, @exit, @bye
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
`@quit`, `@exit`, and `@bye` are the same command: it is the only means to quit Ector.

*Warning*: at this point, if you did not save the ConceptNetwork (using `@write`), all you said since the last save will be lost!

@person
^^^^^^^
The `@person` command let you change your name in the course of the interactive
session:
--------------------
User>@person Bill
Bill>
--------------------

*Warning*: at this point, if you did not save, Ector won't remember your last
conversation state the next time you return as `User`.

@name
^^^^^
The `@name` command let you change the name of the bot, so that when you say
this new name, the bot knows it is him.

*Tip*: don't use this command too much, except if you want to call the bot
another name than "Ector".

@version
^^^^^^^^
Gives the current version of the program. :)

@write
^^^^^^
Writes the ConceptNetwork in `cn.pkl`, in the current directory, *and* the
ConceptNetworkState in `username_state.pkl`, in the same directory.

@shownodes
^^^^^^^^^^
This command displays the nodes of the ConceptNetwork, as in the
ConceptNetworkModule.

This won't display anything unless there are nodes in the ConceptNetwork.
A simple manner to add nodes, is to talk to Ector, naturally.

Example:
--------------------
User>Hi Ector, how are you?
User>@shownodes
       how (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
        Hi (   token): 1 (1,0,0)
Hi @bot@, how are you? (sentence): 1 (1)
       bot (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
         , (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
      User ( utterer): 1 (2008/11/11)
         ? (   token): 1 (0,0,1)
       are (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
       you (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
User>
--------------------

*Warning*: this could overwhelm the screen, if your ConceptNetwork is already
big!

*Note*: at the launch, Ector try to read the `cn.pkl` file. If you already wrote
it, the ConceptNetwork shall not be empty.

@showlinks
^^^^^^^^^^
This command displays the links of the ConceptNetwork, like in
ConceptNetworkModule.

Though it is useful to debug and understand how Ector works, you should not use
it, as the output is long.

Example:
--------------------
User>Hi Ector, how are you?
User>@showlinks
       bot ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
         , ------(100)------->        how
       how ------(100)------->        are
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->          ,
       how ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->         Hi
        Hi ------(100)------->        bot
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        you
       are ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
         ? ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->          ?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        bot
        Hi ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        are
       bot ------(100)------->          ,
       are ------(100)------->        you
         , ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
       you ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->        how
      User ------(100)-------> Hi @bot@, how are you?
Hi @bot@, how are you? ------(100)------->       User
       you ------(100)------->          ?
User>
--------------------

@log
^^^^
This command change the way the log is taken, in two manners:

  1. change the file in which the log is automatically written
  2. stop the logging, giving no filename, or using `@logoff`

Example:
--------------------
User>@log
Log off (ector.log)
--------------------
The logging off display the last log file name.

To log on, or change the name of the log:
--------------------
User>@log test.log
Log file: test.log
--------------------

@status
^^^^^^^
The status command display the nodes of the ConceptNetwork, and the name of the
states that were created:

--------------------
User>@status
       how (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
        Hi (   token): 1 (1,0,0)
Hi @bot@, how are you? (sentence): 1 (1)
       bot (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
         , (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
      User ( utterer): 1 (2008/11/11)
         ? (   token): 1 (0,0,1)
       are (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
       you (   token): 1 (0,1,0)
States (1)
